"I've been using these for over a year now.  Basically, in a quiet environment these sound pretty good.  They aren't as good as similarly-priced studio-class headsets, but you're paying for the noise cancelling.  The raw capability is pretty decent, and has acceptable detail in treble, vocal, and bass ranges.

The noise cancelling works pretty well.  I've taken these on several intercontinental flights and they do a decent job of blocking out engine rumble and screaming kids.  They also do a decent job of blocking out adult human voices, which is nice in the office.

However, I must have pretty big ears, and I've found that the foam cups aren't quite thick enough to adequately push the driver away from my outer ear.  After 2 or 3 hours of use my ears start to ache a bit.

The cord is plenty long, and can be disconnected in the middle to link to an optional Sony wired remote control.  An adapter to convert the standard 1/8th inch stereo jack to the dual 1/8th inch jacks in many airplane seats is included.

The thing that I don't like about this is that I find these uncomfortable when I try to lean my head against the window in an airplane and sleep.  I think that the MDR-NC11's might have been a better choice in that regard.

They're also kind of bulky unless you have a large carry-on to keep them in.  I'm paranoid about putting these in the seat pocket in front of me, since the MDR-NC20's come with a soft bag instead of a rigid clamshell like the Bose headsets.  I haven't had any spills yet, but active travellers may wish to find a case that's more rigid.

All in all, I'm pretty happy with these.  The natural audio sound and the noise cancelling are plenty sufficient for the price... I couldn't justify the $300 for Bose unless I needed the protective clamshell and had ears that fit perfectly into their earcups."
"I have owned these for over two years and wore them about 30 times, mostly on plane rides.

I have a relatively small head, so I keep them at the first expansion level.  Even so, there is a lot of pressure.  After about an hour they start to hurt my ears.  I have tried to ""stretch"" them, but they always return to the same size.  I also put extra foam padding in the ear cups, which helped a little.

They still have good sound quality, and cut noise- although they are not as effective as when I first bought them.

I tried the new Bose.  They fit better and they do a much better job of eliminating noise, but of course they are much more expensive."
"I bought these thinking they were the ticket to noise-free, pleasant air travel.  They fall short for two reasons.  The first is that they just don't cancel that much noise.  If you're not listening to music and just compare the difference between having noise cancellation on and off, it's just not that great - partly because of the technology and partly because of the fit.  To quantify this, the noise canceling Sony headphones give 10dB of noise reduction whereas the passive David Clark H10-00 headphones for roughly the same price give 24dB just because of the better seal.  The second problem is that they generate noise of their own.  If it's not that noisy to start with they actually seem to generate a slight buzz.  So I'd recommend either getting a pair of earplugs, or a set of headphones with a better seal."
"I've owned these for years. I used to fly two round trips a week, and I wore these constantly, whether or not there was any reason to (in flight entertainment, a CD player).

The first benefit is that the noise reduction made speech more audible. I could hear the person in the next seat better, and, in fact, I found that I could eavesdrop on people a row or two away, since the noise that would normally have masked their conversation was masked, but the speech came through.

The loud, constant background sound in airplanes is very draining. I was more likely to be able to nap with these on, and I was more likely to be able to concentrate on reading with less background noise.

Don't get a unit that simply insulates the sound - you might as well use earplugs or sealing earbuds. There is nothing wrong with that solution, it is just that the solution of generated countersound (exactly out of phase, exactly the right amount and frequency for the sound that is incoming), especially when the countersound is based on microphones that are right at the earphones - as far as I am concerned, nothing works as well.

Microphones that are placed in an off-headphone device can't tell where the headphones are direction, or what in the environment might be changing the sound at the headphones. This effect is not as important at low frequencies, but it becomes more important at higher frequencies, so this unit can provide more coverage. The design is simply the best possible - microphones as close to the ear as possible is a huge design benefit.

Well, being in a quiet environment works better, but that is not always available.

When you are flying, especially if you fly a lot, small incremental increases in comfort really are worth it. These cost me less than a quarter per flight, have lasted years and are still going strong.

Sound quality was fine. I could head spoken voice programming just fine, and, far as I was concerned, music was enjoyable. Airline provided programming was much better than the provided headphones."
"I love these headphones!! I got these in Narita Airport and obsessed over them the whole airplane ride from Tokyo to Bangkok...for a very valid reason. These headphones are great. Travelling a lot, I usually have to jack up the volume to nearly full blast and then get a ear-ache after listening for only a short while. But not with these. They cancel most of the noise in the airplane, no more droning sounds! I can now listen to music on the airplane and other noisy places using reasonable volume. I think ths product does what it's supposed to do, cancels most of the noise. It never promised silence, so if that's what you are expecting from these, then don't waste your money. What it does when you turn the noise-cancelling circuit on, however, is cut off most of the very low sounds, so that when you're in places with loud engines sounds (e.g. on an airplane)you won't be able to hear a lot of the grumbles. Plus, this model is an over-the-ear design, so even it cuts off some noise even without the noise-cancelling circuit on.
Some people complain about hissing sounds and I would like to clarify that. These headphones have got 2 systems: 1)normal headphones and 2) noise-cancelling headphones. There are situations where you do not need the noise-cancelling function and you'd be better off turning the circuit system off. When you turn in on in an environment where it is not needed, you will be able to hear a hissing sound that can become annoying. Just turn it off and they'd be fine. As I've mentioned before, these don't promise silence. (Neither do any other headphones.) When you are in a very noisy place, you will not hear the hissing; instead, most of the low grumbling noise will disappear, allowing you to enjoy your music a great deal more.

Also, these have got to be one of the most comfortable earphones you can ever find! If you've done the research on noise-cancelling headphones (like I have), you will find out that a lot of people complain about how a lot of noise-cancelling headphones are very uncomfortable to wear for a long time. Well, good news! These are very comfortable and you can wear them for a long period of time!
These headphones do exactly what they're supposed to do. I just wish they were a tad smaller. That would have been brilliant! I mean, these take up more space than my iPod! Another downside, you wouldn't want to use these for exercising because they are pretty bulky. However, they are not meant to be for use in the gym, so I shouldn't complain.
Overall, great noise-cancelling. Get these and hear the difference!!!"
Work Good. I don't have another reference. You do get tired of wearing them.
"This headphone was my first foray into noise-reduction headphones many years ago and it was a revelation for me.  I used to carry along a portable Sony cd player in my work bag everyday and I used to constantly listen to music during the hour or so long commute each way and I was very happy with the way my cds sounded so much better than they did before.  A big plus is the way only one battery at the side is needed and it lasted very long with the rechargeables that I used.  The compartment was also very conveniently located where battery changes could easily be made without have to remove the headphones and you could still hear music if the switch is in the off position albeit the music sounds a lot better with the switch on.  It is advertised as providing 70% noise reduction and in my opinion that sounds about right which means that if you are looking at noise-reduction as the main feature for your headphones then you should look elsewhere at more expensive options however for a balance of good sound quality and noise reduction this product given the relatively lower price point does represent good value.  There is some level of sound leakage from the cans though but not in my opinion to being too excessive.

As I carried this around with me to work on public transportation the great ability to fold this headphone into a compact ball was a real plus for me.  I have even used these on flights.  After long and extended use, the ear pads started to fray and to flake eventually exposing the foam but it did so only after prolonged use.  Now even after more than 10 years it still plays with a battery although without the battery only the left ear still works but I am really impressed with this old workhorse that has lasted so long.  Many more expensive models out there don't even come close to such durability and hence great value track record that this baby has put in for me.  Given its age and the subsequent progress of noise reduction technology I'm not surprised that this model has been discontinued but for me this pair has served me very well over the years.  I have now just retired this permanently for a Sennheiser Momentum which is not a noise reduction model as I don't travel on public transport as much as I used to and I'm now using another discontinued but fantastically durable workhorse the Philips SHN9500 for flights or whenever some noise reduction is required.

Given the amount of utility I derived from this product for the price point after all these years I have to say that this is certainly one of the better value purchases I have ever made."
"Not as immersive and noise-cancelling as other more expensive models, but I am more than satisfied with the value and would absolutely buy again. Earpieces aren't extremely padded and can get uncomfortable after some hours. Noise canceling works standalone without audio input which is nice for just making things quiet."
I own these and the Bose Quiet Comfort 2 ($250.00) and I can honestly tell you the Bose phones are NOT impressively better and certainly not worth $250.00.
"Sound quality of the headset (noise canceling off) is good.  I'm not an expert, but I'm satisfied with the way music sounds.

As for the noise canceling, I'm not satisfied.  If you've never owned the Bose Quiet Comfort then you may (I repeat may) think this is what noise canceling is all about.  Unfortunately I was once blessed with the opportunity to use a set of the Bose Quiet Comfort Headphones (First Generation) and the noise canceling feature on the MDR-NC20 is weak.

With or without music, there is a lot of static.  This may sound odd (to have a headset on with no music) but one of the great features of noise canceling headsets is to completely block out all the noise around you and allow you to feel isolated from a loud or crowded area.  This is great for working, studying or just relaxing.  However, my MDR-NC20's have annoying static that completely prevents me from having this ability.  You can improve that by unplugging the main portion of the headset from the extended portion of the cord, that plugs into the headphone jack, but it's only an improvement. This doesn't help, if you want to cancel out background noise and listen to music, which to me would be the whole point of wanting noise canceling headphones.

For the price, Sony has allowed the average bear to see what noice canceling is like, to some that may be enough.  I personally wish I had taken the money for the MDR-NC20 and put it towards a set of the Bose.

PS: I wanted to give it two stars.  I accidentally had 3 stars selected and when I went back to edit it, I could not change the rating."
"I have used the headphones for 2 years -- they offer a material reduction in the ""droning"" noise on airplanes.

Even when I am ready to sleep and I turn my music off, I leave the headphones on and it reduces the ambient noise.

I think you arrive much less fatigued."
"I am really satisfied with this purchase. The headphones are clear and can even pick up the signal from great distances as promised. The only problem is the large size of the head phones but they are still worth it. Also, it was able to tune in to FM radio stations, so when I get tired of listening to music from my laptop I can just tune into a radio station for more great music. Well done JVC!!"
"This item gets two stars instead of one because it fits your head really well and the automatic battery recharge is nice, but that's where the good points end.  These headphones force you to constantly retune your reception setting, and they don't ""lock on"" to what you've tuned it to -- they continuously try to verify that the tuning is correct, and disengage repeatedly if you are listening to something with quiet segments.  If you turn on the headphones before you start your music or show, you are treated to loud static.  These work fine if you are listenning to something consistently lively, but if you are listenning to quieter stuff or if there's a gap, you periodically get a bunch of static in your ears.  One program I listened to had such a low base sound volume that I had trouble getting a ""lock"" on it at all, and when I did, and I turned up the volume high enough so I could hear it well, it quickly disconnected and I got deafening static in my ears; these headphones could damage your hearing!  It is a sad statement about JVC that they would allow this product to be sold at all.  I wouldn't be surprised if they get slapped with a few law suits for these."
"Sound Quality very good, easy setup and like the paging function. Only slight negative is that I've worn headsets that are more comfortable, but this one isn't uncomfortable."
These work great for watching tv at night when everyone else is in bed. I highly recommend. No problems for 3 years now.
I bought these at the flea market for 10 dollars. I have loved them ever since. Sounds great and has great range (about 200-300 feet like it says in the manual). The batteries still hold a charge. Great for what I payed for them.
Let's make it short story. It extremly difficult to find the set-up where the sounds is clear. And when it works it's for an extremly short period of time. I would not recommend this item at all.
I purchased this product because I could never hear the TV over the noise of my treadmill.  Now I can catch up on the news and exercise at the same time.  I love it.
"I bought these headphones because I saw other reviewers say they sounded as good as the PortaPro, which I've been buying for years. I'm not an audiophile by any means, but the sound on these headphones is noticeably more muffled. Apparently this is due to the design of the headset and not the drivers themselves. There are online video tutorials that show how to modify the SportPro to achieve clearer audio quality, but I'd rather just pay an extra $10 and buy the PortaPro."
very good for sports.
"The sound is good but I have a large head, and they just seemed a bit tight.  The Portapro may be the best choice."
"They sound decent, cord is too short."
Great sound but the design of the band puts a peice too close to the front of your ear. Otherwise it's a great set of headphones.
"These are good, inexpensive headphones. They emphasize the bass and have good mid-range response."
We were using the Koss sport clips that hung around each ear.  We were glad when we lost of the ear pieces as they were a pain in the A to put on.  So we had to buy a replacement and these SportaPro are GREAT.  Sound is really really nice.  And they are easy to put on.  Very light and excellent for gym and biking.  We recommend these.
"I purchased two headphones a month ago and one was defective, only one speaker works"
"Just used the headphones for the first time today and am very pleased. It has outstanding sound quality and a good deep bass and range of sound. They stay put on my ears and don't move during my workout, but feel comfortable. My only complaint is the carry case it comes with. The headphones even when folded up do not fit inside. Not really a problem."
"The more I wear these headphones, the more I appreciate them.

**Sound Quality**
The sound quality for the money is pretty fantastic (we're talking $20 headphones here). If you compare them to a pair of over-ear cans at a higher price range, prepare to be disappointed. For a good pair of cheap all around headphones with good bass, these fit the bill. They definitely lack in clarity, and there is mid-range detail you just won't hear.

**Comfort**
The more I wear them, the more I like to wear them and forget they're on my head. Clamping force with a pair of over-ear cans is usually an issue for me, and causes headaches. With this on-ear design I don't have that issue (the strategically placed pads above the drivers tend to help).

**Build Quality**
God awful. I transport them in a hard case as I do any other pair of headphones I own, and I wrap them up tight as they were designed. Paint is already coming off the headband, and I'm always afraid I'll break them every time I put them away.

Again, overall they're supremely good for the price. For a *cheap* pair of on-ear headphones, they fit the bill. I actually like these better than my PortaPros, because they don't pull all my hair out constantly. But they don't compare to any of my serious headphones (night and day difference). They're convenient and cheap though, so I'm happy with the purchase."
Great sound for the price. Used for a VIVE headset. The KOSS bag these come with is great. I have a couple from over the years.
"I imagine every headphone designer has a set budget to spend on developing a new product. A certain amount gets spent on how the headphones look, and a different amount on how they sound. It's clear that with the SportaPro, very little got spent on making them look nice. They remind me of headphones I owned in the 90's... that came with a portable tape player... that I got at Dollar General.

Fortunately, whoever engineered these headphones spent their design budget where it counts - the sound. Put simply, the SportaPros sound better than any headphones in this price range have a right to. The word that immediately came to mind when I first tried them out was ""clean"". Everything comes through with superb clarity, good stereo separation and decent warmth. I really like that these headphones give me deep, rich bass without having to jam something in my ears. As an added bonus, they trigger the high impedance mode on my LG V10, and as a result I never have to turn the volume up more than halfway.

A couple minor quibbles - it took some adjustments to get them to fit comfortably, and there are no inline controls. However, at this price I'm not complaining.

If you're an audiophile on a budget, I can't recommend these headphones highly enough."
"amazing, amazing headphones. Lightweight, sound amazing, very low cord noise. I love these."
"I buy at least a couple pair of Koss Headphones or plugs a year, and have for the past 10 years. They never seem to last more than a year, but I guess it's my own fault I never take advantage of their life-time warranty.

I go to the gym a lot, so I need something that is not going to slide off and bump around on my head when I'm working out. I'm sick of plugs, they just really annoy me, and I think they were contributing to hearing loss. I have used the Koss Clips for many years, but the sound quality on those is not as good as a lot of their other stuff.

These however, are among the best sounding headphones I've used, and to my great surprise, the drivers can pop off, and you can pop them on your Koss Clips if you have them! So I haven't even worn these on their intended band, as I've always loved the Clips for how comfortable and stable they are at the gym. I'm going to buy a pair of the more high-end PortaPro series and hopefully those drivers can pop off and go on my clips too, and then I will be so happy.

Still, it's doubtful they will last a year, but I swear i'm going to make use of that warranty next time! Sound quality is definitely a step up from the Clips. Comparable to the KTXPRO1s, or if you aren't familiar with those, notably better than most $50-$100 headphones."
Comfortable headset.  I am profoundly deaf and have to use headset to keep my wife sane.  I can understand U-Tube videos with these even with the bass all the way down and treble all the way up.  Not bad for the price.  Do not block outside noise so I can still hear my wife yell.
"great sound, a bit lite on the head doesn't hold center of ear, band slips a bit, so ok sitting but not so much with active head movements"
"Really good audio quality. Better than my Sennheiser PX 100-II. I also have the Koss KTXPRO1, but the SportaPro fits better. The KTXPRO1 is too big for my son, age 10, but the SportaPro fits him great. I imagine it would fit anyone, because the adjustable band slides from really tiny to really big and everything in between."
"Great sound as advertised, but cannot put behind neck because there is a metal piece that irritates the ear.  I must use on top of my head, the only way!"
Reasonably priced. Good sound. Comfortable. Long cord...perhaps a little too long. I wear it while I walk. Great in cooler weather as it keeps ears warm. I recommend this for those who don't want too spend much and who aren't terribly picky about their headsets.
"They are supposed to be ""sport"" but the foam fell off in a few months.
I bought replacement pads and now the jack falls out of one of my IPods (BTW the problem is not the iPod as other headphone jacks fit fine).
 So now they are useless.
I had better luck in buying an $11 pair of headphones a Wal-Mart.
Please do not buy and look elsewhere"
Sounds like s PortaPro without the ugly blue. Winner!
"I've purchased a bunch of different headphones for running over the last year and a half - many of them breaking or not fitting my needs, and these are just about perfect.
I previously used Sennheiser pmx680s and another older model (not sure of the model number) which were great too, but I keep having issues with the right channel going out randomly. I tried the cambord Bluetooth headphones and they refused to stay in my ears for more than a block. I decided to give these a try because I love my Porta pros and these are almost perfect for me.
There are a few things that I look for on running headphones and it's surprising how hard it is to find any that match up with what I need. These come close, but fall just short.
Here's a quick list of what I like about these. First off, they're semi open back, which lets some traffic noise in. They're inexpensive, especially for their sound quality. I wouldn't think there's anything that can compete with these as far as sound quality goes in this price range.  These stay put on my head while running and I don't have to fiddle with them much at all to get them to be comfortable.
Here's a few minor concerns that I have with them. First off is the cable; it's about four feet long and not ideal for connecting to a phone on an arm band, but I just bundle it up and tuck it in there and it's not a huge issue. I don't think these will hold up if I get caught in the rain...it'd be great if these were waterproof, but I don't think they are. The earpads aren't very comfortable after sweating a bit.  I think that's about it...these are very minor annoyances and I'm going to continue using these for as long as possible."
"Great sound, good bass and very comfortable to wear.  This headset is built much better and sounds a lot better than I had expected.  I use it exclusively for running.  I will try to update to see if it is durable.  Comfort is most important to me.  I can't stand earbuds stuck in my ear canals while I exercise."
"Sound quality is excellent but if you are using these in public, the surrounding people will hear your jams."
"Honestly, these don't work as well as people say they do. The sound quality is decent but I don't find them to be comfortable"
"I like these head phones a lot. I have Phillips behind the ear which or good but these are superior. For $20 you can't go wrong and they really
do have mega-bass,so much so that you may want to increase treble response when using an I-Pod as I do. This would have been 5 stars
BUT even though they can be used behind the head I find them to be uncomfortable and the design makes it tiring for your ears. Give them a
try when you need to replace yours."
Thanks
"GOAT budget headphones, perfect for bassheads without a lot of money.  WILL bleed sound"
"Good, but not great sound, and they stay on when you jog or ride a bike.  Price is right."
"Nothing comes close to these headphones for working out. If earbuds are your thing, these might not be great for you.  I don't like the sound of earbuds and they often shift around. This is where the Sportapros come into play. They fit well and sound great. Plus, the foam ear coverings are available on Amazon for when they get salty/dirty/etc. The bass response is fantastic.

I'm always looking for something cooler and newer.  When ever I try a new headphone, they aren't as good.  There may be some out there, but not for under 22 bucks.  And I bet you can't find replacement ear coverings. I change mine out every few months."
Just ok
"They are too small. They push right up onto my ear and are a little tight. I returned them and paid the fee, I didn't care I hated them. I ended up purchasing a $20 pair of Sonys from Best Buy."
"If you enjoy having the sound of bass overwhelm then these are for you. Personally, I prefer a more balanced sound."
"My third SportaPros.  After the old originals lost a wire, and I decided I wanted a dedicated spare for my overnight bag.  Actually replaced the foam earpads on the originals, which I ordered from Amazon for like two dollars for 6.  Just kept going. I bought $100 Sennheisers but didn't like them as much, too fussy.

PRO:  Good enough for movies and TV shows here with the iPad. Folds down beautifully.  Kick across the room without a worry. Not trying to listen to fine music, though.

CON:  Actually ran with these a couple times, when I couldn't find my running headphones.  Named ""SportaPro"", but I don't like traditional headbands on the top of my head while running.  So if you are looking for running headphones, think about that headband first. Its very light, but not padded, and the sliding part can catch my hair."
"Sound fine, look like crap, feel like crap. I purchased because these are reviewed as having better sound, but I should have gone with better headphones in general. I am not a fan of using these for extended amounts of time."
nice phones
Great sound!! But be careful wires are easily damaged if pulled on. already been through 3 sets over about 15 years used some super glue to adhesive wire to just below where wire enters ear cover.
"I got these to replace my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Koss-PortaPro-Headphones-with-Case/dp/B00001P4ZH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Koss PortaPro Headphones with Case</a>&nbsp;(the cord developed a short at the plug) because I really liked the PortaPros, but the SportaPros were much cheaper.

Comparing the two, these sound just the same and are equally comfortable.  The headband doesn't collapse as easily as on the PortaPros, but I consider that a plus as the headband on those would collapse all on its own when I took them off my head, requiring constant readjustment.  I prefer the straight plug on the PortaPros over the angled plug on the SportaPros, especially if I'm using them plugged into my smartphone in my pocket.  These can be used in a behind-the-neck configuration, but that felt goofy to me and not nearly as comfortable as the purpose built behind the neck headphones I have for working out.

Other than the angled plug, these headphones are exactly what I wanted, especially for the price.  I'd consider paying more for the PortaPros if I were on the go much, but I use these mainly at my desk at work, so the (slightly better) portability isn't worth it to me."
"Flimsy. Other wise 4 1/2 stars. Sound depends on device and app as much as phones. Return policy generous but you will return again and
 again. Buy the extra ear pads!"
"I bought these to replace a set of Koss Port A Pros that I've had for a few years. I slammed the cord in a car door and severed it. Bummer. I took apart the earcups and it is possible to unsolder the connection and replace the cord, but I couldn't find a replacement cord.
So I got these. Plus, the newer model has big problems with volume control, so not gonna go that way. The Sport A Pros are almost as good. Sound is almost as good, headband not quite as good at holding unit tight to my head. About same size. Good enough for IPod use while biking."
"I used to have the radio-shack-branded edition of these (Optimus PRO-45) which were stolen years ago.  I nor work as a night stocker, and needed a new set of portables, and I'm happy to say they haven't changed.  Super light, fold up nice and compact.  They come with a pretty nice ""leather"" bag, though I just keep them in a small pouch inside my backpack.  They also come with a nice heavy, solid feeling 1/4"" adapter if for some reason you like to plug in your portable headphones to an amplifier.  Solid bass all the way to the bottom.  Sound better than Beets solo for sure."
DECENT SOUND FOR THE PRICE ;NOT THE MOST COMFORTABLE OR EASY TO PUT ON.
Excellent thanks
This is our 2nd pair of these headphones. Kids are 9 and they say these are the most comfortable.
Good quality like portapro
"Reasonably good sound.  I bought these for use in the gym.  They have better sound that smaller ""sports"" headphones and becuase they are inexpensive, they are replaceable at minimal cost."
"Excellent phones, full fidelity sound, lightweight, comfortable, great price, wear 'em two ways at least, carrying case fit is questionable."
"Great headphones for the value. Very comfortable, great sound quality. Lets practically all sound in so you can still talk and listen to people, listen to your professor in lecture, hear cars while crossing the street, etc. Overall a great set of on-ear headphones for doing everything."
"For the price its great and the speakers can move in so  many positions I can find the sweet spot for me They are a good deal Im glad I got them though don't turn up all the way
  Very Happy rsder"
Nice headset
"I love these headphones... :)

Forget earbuds that blast your hearing and don't stay put, the Koss SportaPros are excellent for working out or any headphone listening. This model is excellent with sweat.

With the Koss lifetime warranty, I've had my Koss SportaPros replaced a few times (for a small fee), not because of defects or poor quality, rather I simply wear them out. You're not going to find a better headphone for the money and they are worth far more than they cost.

The Koss PortaPro headphones are equally as excellent for a few bucks more. Those are a tad more stylish but otherwise sound about the same as these. I have a couple pairs of those as well.

Not a day goes by that I don't use my Koss headphones with an iPod at the gym, an iPad, and/or and laptop.

I'm hooked on my Koss SportaPros and PortaPros for life and they are one of those products that I can't imagine buying anything else!"
Sounds great for price
"Unusable, returning or going to the landfill.

Why were these designed for the head size of an infant?"
"These are dope. Cheap as heck and sound GREAT. To these ears, they sound even better than the original PortaPro's.

Look for them used on Amazon for an even better deal and then pick up the VEVER case for 10 bucks or so. Keeps 'em protected better than the case that comes with the 'phones.

Lightweight, comfortable, sound good, cheap. DO IT."
"I've been a fan of PortaPro's for a good while now.  The last pair didn't last nearly long enough to suit me.  The sound quality on these is just as good.  And for about $10 less than the PortaPro's it seemed a no brainer to try these before switching to some other brand.  I am probably a lot harder on headphones than most folks that still wear headphones.  Most youngsters are doing ear buds, and I cant stand them.  Still a Koss fan."
Works fine for a low cost portable solution.  Hope it holds up.  For the price - I'm happy!
"Potentially, these are a five star headphone, especially for the price The only reason they get four are some quirks that may be mine alone. First, the  headband itself, for whatever reason, it is NOT comfortable to me in either of its positions. The clmap is a bit hard, and that wide metal band pulls hair out of my head. That's a very subjective thing and I don't fault the design, it's just personal preference.  Secondly, on a sonic level, I find the bass is prominent a little muffled and muddy because of the plastic enclosure the drivers are sealed in. There are two mod(ifications)s you can do for them to really open up that sound and make them fantastic. Both are on youtube. One is more complicated, but not difficult, and involves drilling holes in the various outer and inner plastics. The other is much more simple: Just get this - Parts Express Mini Stereo Lightweight Headphones with 4 ft. Cord. They cost eight dollars here. I just popped the headphones off, threw them away (they are horrible) and snapped the Sportapro drivers onto them for a perfect fit. It took about 45 seconds. This headband is thin, light and durable and makes them sound like five star headphones. They can take the juice of a lot of power--I use a headphone amp but they don't need them without getting distorted and with the mod I did, they sound like five star headphones and are much cheaper than Portapros (even with the mod). Portapros have a slightly different driver and three clamping settings and are also well worth the price. Most people will find them excellent just as they are; I'm a bit of a fussy guy."
great buy.
"I love these things. They're so comfortable and light and sound just as good as my larger cans-style headphones. Surprisingly ""big"" sounding with a decent soundstage and better separation than most cans (at least the ones I've tried). the impedance is a little low and they're good and loud, but might not handle really loud volume as well as heavier-duty headphones. I do get a slight bass rattle at times.

Perfectly easy to lay down and listen before bed or at the desk at work, so i've just been taking them back and forth. I like the way my SUPERLUX cans sound but they're just so big and heavy that i've been going solely with these and not missing the others at all. For the price this is an easy 5 stars for sound and comfort"
"light weight, great sound"
Nice sound of KOSS. Better than PortaPro for me.
"The Koss family of Sporta/Porta/ksc75 are unique. Go to headfi-dot-org and you'll find a series of mods that turn these into near audiophile. I said near, so that those who want to spend mega bucks can sleep better at night. The basic phones are cheap enough, and the mods widespread that you can dial your own portable, workout, at home, chillin, etc. variety right down to the music genre (jazz, classic, rock, etc.)."
"I found these in a box recently, the ear foam cushions were dissolved.  Cursing the ""cheap"" materials, and why oh why do they make the cushions self destruct after some period of time.  Then I looked up replacement cushions, which they make..... I was shocked to find I bought these in 2002.  13 years is a lot for anything to last now a days.  Considering I used these in traveling, and with everything in traveling, they were not treated with kid gloves.  The sound quality of these were good,  I bought the replacement foam (made by Koss)  just because it seemed like the right thing to do after cursing them.  It says here that Amazon still sells them.  I find that hard to believe given their cost compared to what you can buy now a days.  But what you buy now will not be around in 13 years.  So I have to rate them high just for the longevity.  I doubt anyone will read this, but here it is."
These things sound awesome!
Not very comfortable but good sound
"Great headphones, great price, cable is garbage though. Buy two or three, and wait until all the cables break to send them in for the lifetime warranty so you save money on shipping."
"Works really well. Great for use during exercise, hated having the ear plugs in my ear as they would hurt after a while. This fits nice and snug, sound is clear, would recommend."
"I have had a pair of these for 7-8 years that I use at the gym (running and lifting weights) 2-3 days a week.  I throw them in my gym back, they rattle around in the trunk of my car year round and they never miss a beat and still going strong.  I would say nearly bullet proof as I have broken man other headphones in my day in this same usage.  I have replaced the ear pads once (bought  6 sets of them on amazon for around $5).  The sound quality is also so much better than any ear buds I have ever had as well, plus they fold up small and fit in the pocket of my gym shorts.  I cannot imagine a better pair for anywhere near this price."
"They get the job done. Not the best pair I own, however I am not disappointed in them."
"I did not like this headphone style. It came with no instructions on how to properly fit it on my head, some sort of diagram of even just a picture of someone wearing it would of helped. Spent 30 minutes rotating it around trying to figure out what angle works best. In the end I decided it was too uncomfortable, and I couldn't keep it in place on my ears. The metal headband piece rotates so you can wear it as a normal over the head style, but its not very comfortable. That was the only position I could keep it in place, if I tilted it back behind my neck the earpieces slid forward too much. I would then adjust the band to be smaller, but that just squeezed the earpieces outward at a weird angle. The whole reason I bought this headphone was so I could wear it with my hat while jogging, but it sticks out to much above my ear. The hat just gets in the way and pushes it down so it slides off my ears. No matter what position I tried I could not get this to be comfortable and stay in place. Returned it and will buy a different style.

The quality of sound was excellent though, didn't have any complaints on that end, which is why I gave it at least 2 stars."
"For 20 Bucks, you got to love em. Collapsible, great sound (for the little bit of money), and, like their bigger brother the Porta Pros, you get a fabulous lifetime warranty, same large wide sound and portabilty. What more can you ask for?"
"Great sound quality, pulled them off and put them on the KSC75 clips for comfort.
Some of the best sound quality I've heard in their price bracket. Definitely get the clips and make sure they fit snug"
"These sound great. Good balance, nice bass. Old school and done right."
"They may not be ""Beats"" but these headphones fold into a compact little package. I bring it with me when I travel and use it for my phone, Kindle Fire, and laptop."
Fits nicely and has a very well balanced treble and base with a very clear sharp quality sound
These phones sound great especially considering how inexpensive they are!!  They are adjustable for over the head or behind the head.  I'm not sure they would stay put when jogging though.
"I just broke out a pair of these from the headphone graveyard. They sound amazing! The bass is thumping and the treble is as crisp as an Italian Pizzelle off an iron on a Sicilian street. The foam was worn out, so I swapped out some old KSC-75 foamies. The drivers are much better. The only reason that I am taking off a star is because they are so ugly. If you are looking to be an extra in a Star Wars Comi-Con and need an authentic early eighties-thing, then this is it. Enough said. If you are looking for fantastic sound and are not in the market for fashion points(BEATS by DRE...which are actually terrible) these are the ones for you. Who knows...if you get famous athletes and rappers to market great sound(LOL)make these the first on your list."
Great headphones.
very sweet sounding for the money the babys out play much more expensive brands not bad for a product that's been around sence the 80's
"These headphone are great for jogging.  The sound quality is superb for the price.  The build quality is quite good as well.

I was looking for a good headphone for running.  I knew I didn't want in-ear monitors as they are very uncomfortable for me and I don't like the fact that with most models you can't hear your surroundings very well, which I believe is very important when you are running on a road.  I also didn't want ear buds as the sound quality is very subpar.  In fact, the bass response in ear buds are so bad that it forces you to turn up the volume to higher and the higher until the high frequencies end up damaging your hearing.  The Koss SportaPro is an on-ear open headphone.  This allows for you to hear your surroundings, while at the same time enjoy airy and dynamic music.

Talking about sound quality, I am very impressed.  These headphones sound well above their price range.  If you were listening to Apple ear buds like I was before getting these, you will know what I mean when I say it's like getting a whole new set of ears.  The bass is tight and accurate, but can get a little muddy when pushed to the limit.  Where these cans shine is in the midrange.  It is even, transparent, and dynamic.  Unless you have had a great pair of speakers or headphones in the past you will be surprised at how many notes the Sportapros will dig up that you have never heard before when listening to your old favorite tracks.  The highs aren't too shabby either.  They hold their weight and were surprisingly clear and soft for this price bracket.

The build quality of the SportaPro is solid while light weight, which makes for a very good exercise pair of headphones.  They are built to last.  The top band, believe it or not, is metal.  There are also 2 metal clips that hold these cans together when you fold them up.  They could have just put plastic clips on there, but Koss seems like they are serious about quality and went the extra mile on this one. The one caveat seems to be the cords that go into the drivers.  They are very thin and have no bend protection.  I'm not sure how well those cords would hold up if you got tangled and it got tugged or if bent the cord a certain way every time you folded them up.

Overall, you truly can't beat these for the price.  It's amazing what Koss has done with these to make them so affordable.  I wasn't necessarily looking for great sound quality when getting a pair of exercise headphones.  I just wanted something comfortable and sound quality that wouldn't necessarily make me want to throw up.  Even after all the great reviews, I was surprised at the performance level of the SportaPros.  These are an excellent buy."
"The bass is too emphasized, muddying up the midrange. And since midrange is 75% of music, these don't cut it. Then again if all you care about is bass, you might like them."
"These headphones really surprised me.  The sound is very good, and unlike ""ear buds,"" are not affected by perspiration during your workout.  I suggest you get the package of extra foam pads."
"These are an amazing value for the price. As others have mentioned, why change a great thing. This is my first pair of Koss headphones and they sound better than some other supposedly higher quality and priced headphones."
Great sound but the cord failed at the plug sooner than the other style plug otherwise 5 stars.
Sound is very good and construction is of good quality.
"For cheap headphones, these are a pair that I really don't want to be without.  I keep a spare set, just in case.  I wear BTE hearing aids, so these headphones will fit right on top of the aids, just above my ears, and they're still very comfortable.  The foam cushions help drown out a bit of the background noise and the earphones work with my hearing aids to give me as good a range as digital aids with music is going to get.  It's not perfect, but it works quite well.  I can't speak for how these sound without hearing aids, since my hearing is so bad that I can't hear them at all without the aids."
"It's hard to beat the sound quality and easy of use, but these left my ears a little uncomfortable. I don't want to say that I have large ears, but they might be on the large side. The latch bar and hook that's part of the folding system dig into my ears. I set them higher to deal with it, but they eventually slide down and start to hurt my ears. This isn't a huge issue, I don't often wear them long enough to make it a problem.

There are some weird acoustic issues, but they're not too noticeable, especially is you plan on using these while running or while at the gym. The casing causes a weird echoing issue, something the standard Portapros do away with with their open system.

For standard listening, I highly suggest making the upgrade to the Portapros."
Good price and sound
"I bought it elsewhere but buying on Amazon would allow better protection against DOA and for returns.
If you do scientific measurements (like frequency response, CSD, impulse responses) on sportapro and portapro, you will find that both are near identical. They seem to share the same drivers and only have a slight difference in ear pressure when you wear them.

This is an excellent buy because both this and portapro offers good sound. I have tried out many different headphones before, from a dollar ones to thousand dollars ones (not own by me but during tryouts and festivals), and will say sportapro offers a sound that stands in the mid ground, that is a clear winner compare to stock apple earbuds, and only slightly disadvantageous compare to the new earpods. There are many hundreds dollars headphone worse than this in sound (say dre beats) which can be proven using scientific measurements.

Comfort on head: 3 stars. This headphone is light enough for you to forget its existence until you take it off, where it will catch your hair and make you lose a few strands.

Noise-cancelling: no stars. You can hear your surroundings and the people outside can hear you.

Design: 3 stars. You can fold it into fist size and carry it around, which many headphones cannot do. The metal band can swivel backwards but I rarely found that useful. The foam earpad goes bad fairly quickly, especially if you run and sweat got on it.

Sound: 3.5 stars. Bass is not too tight and can be overpowering the mid frequencies, but not too much. There is clarity and openness in the sound this headphone makes. Despite its sound does not accurately follows the original (if you compare the waveforms of song on your CD to sound made by this), it is fun to listen and the lifetime warranty gives you a peace of mind."
"these are best base I can find - I wish KOSS would just put thicker wires that hold up at gym - the silver ones have a bit better bass for working out ( keep in mind I using these for motivating me ) - not saying I would pick these over AKG quality studio monitor headphones.  These are best and trust me, EE , taken these apart - KOSS knows how to bring a product to market, cost low, and quality.  I have 6 sets - and I only issue is don't fold wires near plug into device or PULL wires with thin audio cables ...
I highly recommend them for GYM - just be aware of wires are normal thin under $40 quality product vs. higher end headphone wires used.  YOU will be amazed at bass vs. a 80 buck set - IF you want to motivated to work out ( PS -DON""T put headphones that go over ear that hold heat in - many dr. will tell you this that know - your ears are one of the major places your workout body heat comes off head- thus those EAR BUDS you shove in your ears are keeping hotter than something like this at least letting heat out ... you may look ""cool-er"" but if you want real good bass, low cost, good sound , and added plus of folding headphones, these are best I have tested out of 50+ as hardware junkie working for hw + sw company for 24 years ...  I am QA Manager"
These are uncomfortable to wear around the back of my head.  It pinches my ears badly - leaving them sore after 20 minutes.  I ended up hanging them over my head instead of using them as a wrap around.  The sound quality is decent.
"These are working well for running/walking. I like the fact you can position the band behind your head which is most comfortable for me. Some have said the clamping force makes them too tight but I haven't had any discomfort. The bass is strong, a tad too strong for me. The mids and highs aren't muddled - there is detail there, just hard to hear over the bass. This is acceptable for running, I have my Grado's for home listening (the 1/4"" adapter plug is the same that came w/my Grado). Overall, the sound quality is better than anything I've heard in this price range. The build quality is good, should hold up w/ a little careful handling. I do like how they fold up for storage. Koss builds a good product for the money and these are no exception."
"they have good sound for a cheap price, they also small and easy to put in a pocket or a bag, the reason i got them."
"Sorry I bought these.  They are supposed to rotate and lock into one of 2 positions ... one side does, the other doesn't and locks up half way. They way they rest on your ears is painful for any extended length of time. Cheaply made, but the sound isn't too bad."
These are very comfortable and does not fall off even during a rough bike ride. The sound quality ain't half bad either. The only thing I would change is some of the wearable parts. I can understand the ear pads as they are replaceable but the foam piece right above the ears look a bit flimsy and might fall off over time and they are NOT replaceable.
"The classic PortaPro with a head or neck band. It may be a bit geeky looking but who cares. Headphones are about the sound quality and these are incredible for the price. Your friends will be amazed when they try them. Koss is a great brand, very reliable and offers terrific customer service."
"Compared to PortaPros, the construction feels a lot cheaper (plastic vs metal) and I feel like the lower end is a teeny bit muddier. Also a heads up, these are probably very fragile. I stuck with PortaPros for about 3 years, breaking many pairs in various ways (consistently, the left or the right headphone would stop working), but just buying another one because they're such great headphones at that price point. I've decided to go with a higher end pair (Sennheiser Momentums) for work/home use which will hopefully not break as often and use SportaPros while biking or at the gym, as these are really light and still have excellent sound.
