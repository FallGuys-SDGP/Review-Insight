"https://www.hi.com I have owned these for over two years and wore them about 30 times, mostly on plane rides."
I'll be there within 5 min. Shouldn't you be there too? 
"I ** [bought] these thinking they were the ticket to noise-free, pleasant air travel.  "
#Work Good. I do not have another reference. You do get tired of wearing them.
"भारत Not as immersive and noise-cancelling as other more expensive models, but I am more than satisfied with the value and would absolutely buy again. "
DINUVI  I own these and the Bose Quiet Comfort 2 ($250.00) and I can honestly tell you the Bose phones are NOT impressively better and certainly not worth $250.00.
�� I bought these at the flea market for 10 dollars. I have loved them ever since. Sounds great and has great range (about 200-300 feet like it says in the manual). The batteries still hold a charge. Great for what I payed for them.
Let's make it short story. It extremly difficult to find the set-up where the sounds is clear. And when it works it's for an extremly short period of time. I would not recommend this item at all.
I purchased this product because I could never hear the TV over the noise of my treadmill.  Now I can catch up on the news and exercise at the same time.  I love it.
