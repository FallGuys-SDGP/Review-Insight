My only problem with them is the way they fit on my ears. I like the style because I wear hearing aids and can't wear earbuds or anything that must go into the ear canal even just a little. These work but put too much pressure on the cartilage, leaving it very sore after a while. They're great for my husband."}}}},{"PutRequest":{"Item":{"asin":{"S":"B00ZAFM6D4"},"reviewID":{"S":"87979"},"title":{"S":"Sennheiser PX 685i Headband In-Ear Sports Headphones - White (Certified Refurbished)"},"brand":{"S":"Sennheiser"},"overall":{"S":"4"},"vote":{"S":""},"verified":{"S":"TRUE"},"summary":{"S":"Four Stars"},"reviewerID":{"S":"A1IGLMZEUB2DTQ"},"unixReviewTime":{"S":"1443830400"},"reviewText":{"S":"Work well because I sweat a lot."}}}},{"PutRequest":{"Item":{"asin":{"S":"B00ZAFM6D4"},"reviewID":{"S":"87980"},"title":{"S":"Sennheiser PX 685i Headband In-Ear Sports Headphones - White (Certified Refurbished)"},"brand":{"S":"Sennheiser"},"overall":{"S":"5"},"vote":{"S":"5"},"verified":{"S":"TRUE"},"summary":{"S":"I wish they made more like this"},"reviewerID":{"S":"A1Z4ETGZZHVT6W"},"unixReviewTime":{"S":"1440547200"},"reviewText":{"S":"Sadly over the head sports type earphones are harder and harder to find, a real problem for eyeglass wearers or if your ear canal is shaped such that ear buds simply will not stay in place or are uncomfortable. Just because manufacturers stopped making them does not mean there is not a market for them. Ear clip type headphones and rear headband type ear phones also simply do not work for me. I doubt I am the only one with these first world problems.\n\nThese Sennheisers are great units with good sound, microphone and volume adjustment. The refurbished units seem to work just as well as \"new.\" Since I have to constantly have a phone it is a great convenience to have the inline microphone that works with an Iphonef or the types of sports I do."}}}},{"PutRequest":{"Item":{"asin":{"S":"B016LCPPKA"},"reviewID":{"S":"87981"},"title":{"S":"Sony Premium Noise-Canceling Lightweight Extra Bass Stereo Headphones Plus Kubicle Case"},"brand":{"S":"Sony"},"overall":{"S":"4"},"vote":{"S":""},"verified":{"S":"TRUE"},"summary":{"S":"Am pleased with the headphones overall"},"reviewerID":{"S":"A24OSYT3859AFP"},"unixReviewTime":{"S":"1535500800"},"reviewText":{"S":"Am pleased with the headphones overall, the noise cancellation is better than the Turtle Beach i30's that I have, but a bit less than a cheaper off-brand I have.  Other than being corded rather than bluetooth, can think of nothing else to share other than the flat foldability is perfect for storage."}}}},{"PutRequest":{"Item":{"asin":{"S":"B016LCPPKA"},"reviewID":{"S":"87982"},"title":{"S":"Sony Premium Noise-Canceling Lightweight Extra Bass Stereo Headphones Plus Kubicle Case"},"brand":{"S":"Sony"},"overall":{"S":"3"},"vote":{"S":""},"verified":{"S":"TRUE"},"summary":{"S":"Just OK"},"reviewerID":{"S":"A94PZYDJHB1W8"},"unixReviewTime":{"S":"1524441600"},"reviewText":{"S":"Good sound.

They are comfortable to wear and fold into a compact carrying case (sold separately).  I love that (unlike my older Bose) I can use these as headphones even if the battery is dead.  The fact that they use an AAA batter rather than a proprietary rechargeable battery means I never really worry about running out of juice because batteries are easy to find.  Perfect for travel!"}}}},{"PutRequest":{"Item":{"asin":{"S":"B016LCPPKA"},"reviewID":{"S":"87984"},"title":{"S":"Sony Premium Noise-Canceling Lightweight Extra Bass Stereo Headphones Plus Kubicle Case"},"brand":{"S":"Sony"},"overall":{"S":"3"},"vote":{"S":""},"verified":{"S":"FALSE"},"summary":{"S":"Decent sound, decent noise cancelling, uncomfortable to the point of not wanting to wear them."},"reviewerID":{"S":"A2BRFCWPML1R5O"},"unixReviewTime":{"S":"1513641600"},"reviewText":{"S":"Sound wise, these are nice enough. Not heavy base. Not heavy anything, really. Just middle of the road. I would not recommend these however. I find that after about an hour or so, they become seriously uncomfortable. I don't have huge ears or anything like that. They just are not comfortable. I also have a pair of Bose N/C headphones and can wear those for hours on end. They cost a ton more though. I wear headphones off and on, but when I do, i tend to wear them for hours on end. I prefer comfort."}}}},{"PutRequest":{"Item":{"asin":{"S":"B016LCPPKA"},"reviewID":{"S":"87985"},"title":{"S":"Sony Premium Noise-Canceling Lightweight Extra Bass Stereo Headphones Plus Kubicle Case"},"brand":{"S":"Sony"},"overall":{"S":"3"},"vote":{"S":"2"},"verified":{"S":"TRUE"},"summary":{"S":"a reasonably good buy."},"reviewerID":{"S":"A24U1ASV0XDERI"},"unixReviewTime":{"S":"1490572800"},"reviewText":{"S":"They work.
