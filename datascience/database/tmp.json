The good Skullcandy headphones are upwards from $60 and the Beats line is insane in their pricing (I still question why people purchase Beats, especially the ones costing $300). The Skullcandy headphones that are $40 are too flimsy for my taste and Sony headphones can be pretty steep as well... until this model was introduced. The ZX100 are the cheapest over-ear headphones by a good brand I've ever seen (not to say brands like Coby aren't good, but their quality sometimes misses the mark). These headphones work incredibly well and can take a lot of abuse. I could not recommend this more."}}}},{"PutRequest":{"Item":{"asin":{"S":"B004WODP20"},"reviewID":{"S":"47977"},"title":{"S":"Sony MDRZX100 Headphones (Black)"},"brand":{"S":"Sony"},"overall":{"S":"5"},"vote":{"S":""},"verified":{"S":"TRUE"},"summary":{"S":"It exceeded my expectations!!"},"reviewerID":{"S":"A3BWGM5HH23FQP"},"unixReviewTime":{"S":"1350691200"},"reviewText":{"S":"Keepeng in mind that this headphones are really cheap, they are excellent. In my opinion, you get even more than you paid for. They sound quite good, even though not at a professional level. Besides, they look really cool.\n\nYou should really buy them, specially if you're interested in a set of headphones that are great for going outdoors (they are not noise canceling though), and at a price range excelent for those who frequently brake or lose them.\n\nGo ahead and buy them.

I've never blown headphone speakers. Maybe once... I wanna new one or I'm gonna go buy something else...\nThe positive is that the speakers fold, its got an equalizer so no they don't suck. You have to adjust your mp3's sound... go to equalizer. If you don't have that option its your mp3 that sucks.\nSound is okay/cool and I love that the right side has a read mark so u can easily know what side to put where.\nMy ones just blew which sucked...If they didn't break I'd give them a 3 1/2."}}}},{"PutRequest":{"Item":{"asin":{"S":"B004WODP20"},"reviewID":{"S":"47982"},"title":{"S":"Sony MDRZX100 Headphones (Black)"},"brand":{"S":"Sony"},"overall":{"S":"5"},"vote":{"S":""},"verified":{"S":"TRUE"},"summary":{"S":"great quality for the price"},"reviewerID":{"S":"A1MJPGYK9MOSB6"},"unixReviewTime":{"S":"1349395200"},"reviewText":{"S":"SONY consistently delivers good quality.

Another hidden benefit is that number of times people interrupting me has dropped.\n\nI was afraid that these might be too heavy.

The headphones are cheap, but not terrible.  There are hidden gems on Amazon, cheap headphones with wonderful sound quality, but these are not them.  They're fine.\n\nThe problem is the things pinch my head.  I do not have an especially large head; I wear standard size caps, etc.  These headphones just press really firmly, I assume in an attempt to stay on your head (which doesn't work, by the way; don't take these running or anything).  It's uncomfortable immediately, and I get a headache not too long after that lasts long after I take them off.\n\nThis is the only pair of headphones I've ever used (even at this price point) that had this problem, so I was pretty surprised.\n\nEDIT: I had a friend of mine (a youngish girl) try them on.  She agreed they were quite unpleasant to wear, and her head is actually pretty small.

On MP3 players that are not very loud, like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/SanDisk-Sansa-Clip-4-GB-MP3-Player-Black/dp/B002MAPT7U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">SanDisk Sansa Clip+ 4 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a>, the headphones are not loud at all!\n- The headphones don't go over the ears, but touch the ears on the outside, causing less of a sound damping than the coby's\n- The plastic bar going over the head (the one holding the speakers) is made for very fat faces. If you have a slim or normal face, the plastic bar will look funny (too wide).\n- Nearly twice the price of the coby's\n\ntech specs from the package (minus all the promoting bull):\n- 30mm drivers, dome type\n- Handling capacity: 1W (IEC)\n- 24Ohms\n- 100dB\n- 12Hz-22kHz\n- Cord = 1,2m\n- Stereo mini jack plug\n- ~150 grams\n\nConclusion:\n\nGreat headphones for the price; best used for studio equipment, not portable devices running on battery, as the headphones volume is really too low, noticeably (6 to 9dB) less volume than the Coby's on these low power devices. I presume it performs better at higher volumes or voltages (like the which you can get from powered mixing boards, and external amplifiers)."}}}},{"PutRequest":{"Item":{"asin":{"S":"B004WODP20"},"reviewID":{"S":"47999"},"title":{"S":"Sony MDRZX100 Headphones (Black)"},"brand":{"S":"Sony"},"overall":{"S":"4"},"vote":{"S":""},"verified":{"S":"TRUE"},"summary":{"S":"Awsome"},"reviewerID":{"S":"A1GR8RRYWSBFFH"},"unixReviewTime":{"S":"1347062400"},"reviewText":{"S":"To be honest i didn't expect that amazing sound from those little headphones,but belive me they are great!!!!\nAnd let me tell you i have paid more for a couple of headphones(Bose)..."}}}},{"PutRequest":{"Item":{"asin":{"S":"B004WODP20"},"reviewID":{"S":"48000"},"title":{"S":"Sony MDRZX100 Headphones (Black)"},"brand":{"S":"Sony"},"overall":{"S":"4"},"vote":{"S":""},"verified":{"S":"TRUE"},"summary":{"S":"Excellent"},"reviewerID":{"S":"A26RH6MTBT1LX5"},"unixReviewTime":{"S":"1346803200"},"reviewText":{"S":"Excellent by it price.
