      "|| Real || > I've been using these for over a year now.  Basically, in a quiet environment these sound pretty good.  They aren't as good as similarly-priced studio-class headsets, but you're paying for the noise cancelling.  The raw capability is pretty decent, and has acceptable detail in treble, vocal, and bass ranges.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The noise cancelling works pretty well.  I've taken these on several intercontinental flights and they do a decent job of blocking out engine rumble and screaming kids.  They also do a decent job of blocking out adult human voices, which is nice in the office.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "However, I must have pretty big ears, and I've found that the foam cups aren't quite thick enough to adequately push the driver away from my outer ear.  After 2 or 3 hours of use my ears start to ache a bit.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The cord is plenty long, and can be disconnected in the middle to link to an optional Sony wired remote control.  An adapter to convert the standard 1/8th inch stereo jack to the dual 1/8th inch jacks in many airplane seats is included.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The thing that I don't like about this is that I find these uncomfortable when I try to lean my head against the window in an airplane and sleep.  I think that the MDR-NC11's might have been a better choice in that regard.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They're also kind of bulky unless you have a large carry-on to keep them in.  I'm paranoid about putting these in the seat pocket in front of me, since the MDR-NC20's come with a soft bag instead of a rigid clamshell like the Bose headsets.  I haven't had any spills yet, but active travellers may wish to find a case that's more rigid.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All in all, I'm pretty happy with these.  The natural audio sound and the noise cancelling are plenty sufficient for the price... I couldn't justify the $300 for Bose unless I needed the protective clamshell and had ears that fit perfectly into their earcups. \n",

      "|| Real || > I have owned these for over two years and wore them about 30 times, mostly on plane rides.\r\n",

I have tried to \"stretch\" them, but they always return to the same size.  I also put extra foam padding in the ear cups, which helped a little.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They still have good sound quality, and cut noise- although they are not as effective as when I first bought them.\r\n",

      "\n",
      "|| Real || > I bought these thinking they were the ticket to noise-free, pleasant air travel.  They fall short for two reasons.  The first is that they just don't cancel that much noise.  If you're not listening to music and just compare the difference between having noise cancellation on and off, it's just not that great - partly because of the technology and partly because of the fit.  To quantify this, the noise canceling Sony headphones give 10dB of noise reduction whereas the passive David Clark H10-00 headphones for roughly the same price give 24dB just because of the better seal.  The second problem is that they generate noise of their own.  If it's not that noisy to start with they actually seem to generate a slight buzz.  So I'd recommend either getting a pair of earplugs, or a set of headphones with a better seal. \n",
      "\n",
      "|| Real || > I've owned these for years. I used to fly two round trips a week, and I wore these constantly, whether or not there was any reason to (in flight entertainment, a CD player).\r\n",

      "The first benefit is that the noise reduction made speech more audible. I could hear the person in the next seat better, and, in fact, I found that I could eavesdrop on people a row or two away, since the noise that would normally have masked their conversation was masked, but the speech came through.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The loud, constant background sound in airplanes is very draining. I was more likely to be able to nap with these on, and I was more likely to be able to concentrate on reading with less background noise.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Don't get a unit that simply insulates the sound - you might as well use earplugs or sealing earbuds. There is nothing wrong with that solution, it is just that the solution of generated countersound (exactly out of phase, exactly the right amount and frequency for the sound that is incoming), especially when the countersound is based on microphones that are right at the earphones - as far as I am concerned, nothing works as well.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Microphones that are placed in an off-headphone device can't tell where the headphones are direction, or what in the environment might be changing the sound at the headphones. This effect is not as important at low frequencies, but it becomes more important at higher frequencies, so this unit can provide more coverage. The design is simply the best possible - microphones as close to the ear as possible is a huge design benefit.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Well, being in a quiet environment works better, but that is not always available.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When you are flying, especially if you fly a lot, small incremental increases in comfort really are worth it. These cost me less than a quarter per flight, have lasted years and are still going strong.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sound quality was fine. I could head spoken voice programming just fine, and, far as I was concerned, music was enjoyable. Airline provided programming was much better than the provided headphones. \n",

      "|| Fake || > I love these headphones!! I got these in Narita Airport and obsessed over them the whole airplane ride from Tokyo to Bangkok...for a very valid reason. These headphones are great. Travelling a lot, I usually have to jack up the volume to nearly full blast and then get a ear-ache after listening for only a short while. But not with these. They cancel most of the noise in the airplane, no more droning sounds! I can now listen to music on the airplane and other noisy places using reasonable volume. I think ths product does what it's supposed to do, cancels most of the noise. It never promised silence, so if that's what you are expecting from these, then don't waste your money. What it does when you turn the noise-cancelling circuit on, however, is cut off most of the very low sounds, so that when you're in places with loud engines sounds (e.g. on an airplane)you won't be able to hear a lot of the grumbles. Plus, this model is an over-the-ear design, so even it cuts off some noise even without the noise-cancelling circuit on.\r\n",
      "Some people complain about hissing sounds and I would like to clarify that. These headphones have got 2 systems: 1)normal headphones and 2) noise-cancelling headphones. There are situations where you do not need the noise-cancelling function and you'd be better off turning the circuit system off. When you turn in on in an environment where it is not needed, you will be able to hear a hissing sound that can become annoying. Just turn it off and they'd be fine. As I've mentioned before, these don't promise silence. (Neither do any other headphones.) When you are in a very noisy place, you will not hear the hissing; instead, most of the low grumbling noise will disappear, allowing you to enjoy your music a great deal more.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Also, these have got to be one of the most comfortable earphones you can ever find! If you've done the research on noise-cancelling headphones (like I have), you will find out that a lot of people complain about how a lot of noise-cancelling headphones are very uncomfortable to wear for a long time. Well, good news! These are very comfortable and you can wear them for a long period of time!\r\n",
      "These headphones do exactly what they're supposed to do. I just wish they were a tad smaller. That would have been brilliant! I mean, these take up more space than my iPod! Another downside, you wouldn't want to use these for exercising because they are pretty bulky. However, they are not meant to be for use in the gym, so I shouldn't complain.\r\n",
      "Overall, great noise-cancelling. Get these and hear the difference!!! \n",

      "\n",
      "|| Real || > This headphone was my first foray into noise-reduction headphones many years ago and it was a revelation for me.  I used to carry along a portable Sony cd player in my work bag everyday and I used to constantly listen to music during the hour or so long commute each way and I was very happy with the way my cds sounded so much better than they did before.  A big plus is the way only one battery at the side is needed and it lasted very long with the rechargeables that I used.  The compartment was also very conveniently located where battery changes could easily be made without have to remove the headphones and you could still hear music if the switch is in the off position albeit the music sounds a lot better with the switch on.  It is advertised as providing 70% noise reduction and in my opinion that sounds about right which means that if you are looking at noise-reduction as the main feature for your headphones then you should look elsewhere at more expensive options however for a balance of good sound quality and noise reduction this product given the relatively lower price point does represent good value.  There is some level of sound leakage from the cans though but not in my opinion to being too excessive.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As I carried this around with me to work on public transportation the great ability to fold this headphone into a compact ball was a real plus for me.  I have even used these on flights.  After long and extended use, the ear pads started to fray and to flake eventually exposing the foam but it did so only after prolonged use.  Now even after more than 10 years it still plays with a battery although without the battery only the left ear still works but I am really impressed with this old workhorse that has lasted so long.  Many more expensive models out there don't even come close to such durability and hence great value track record that this baby has put in for me.  Given its age and the subsequent progress of noise reduction technology I'm not surprised that this model has been discontinued but for me this pair has served me very well over the years.  I have now just retired this permanently for a Sennheiser Momentum which is not a noise reduction model as I don't travel on public transport as much as I used to and I'm now using another discontinued but fantastically durable workhorse the Philips SHN9500 for flights or whenever some noise reduction is required.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Given the amount of utility I derived from this product for the price point after all these years I have to say that this is certainly one of the better value purchases I have ever made. \n",
      "\n",
      "|| Real || > Not as immersive and noise-cancelling as other more expensive models, but I am more than satisfied with the value and would absolutely buy again. Earpieces aren't extremely padded and can get uncomfortable after some hours. Noise canceling works standalone without audio input which is nice for just making things quiet. \n",
      "\n",
      "|| Real || > I own these and the Bose Quiet Comfort 2 ($250.00) and I can honestly tell you the Bose phones are NOT impressively better and certainly not worth $250.00. \n",

      "|| Real || > Sound quality of the headset (noise canceling off) is good.  I'm not an expert, but I'm satisfied with the way music sounds.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As for the noise canceling, I'm not satisfied.  If you've never owned the Bose Quiet Comfort then you may (I repeat may) think this is what noise canceling is all about.  Unfortunately I was once blessed with the opportunity to use a set of the Bose Quiet Comfort Headphones (First Generation) and the noise canceling feature on the MDR-NC20 is weak.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With or without music, there is a lot of static.  This may sound odd (to have a headset on with no music) but one of the great features of noise canceling headsets is to completely block out all the noise around you and allow you to feel isolated from a loud or crowded area.  This is great for working, studying or just relaxing.  However, my MDR-NC20's have annoying static that completely prevents me from having this ability.  You can improve that by unplugging the main portion of the headset from the extended portion of the cord, that plugs into the headphone jack, but it's only an improvement. This doesn't help, if you want to cancel out background noise and listen to music, which to me would be the whole point of wanting noise canceling headphones.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For the price, Sony has allowed the average bear to see what noice canceling is like, to some that may be enough.  I personally wish I had taken the money for the MDR-NC20 and put it towards a set of the Bose.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\n",
      "|| Real || > This item gets two stars instead of one because it fits your head really well and the automatic battery recharge is nice, but that's where the good points end.  These headphones force you to constantly retune your reception setting, and they don't \"lock on\" to what you've tuned it to -- they continuously try to verify that the tuning is correct, and disengage repeatedly if you are listening to something with quiet segments.  If you turn on the headphones before you start your music or show, you are treated to loud static.  These work fine if you are listenning to something consistently lively, but if you are listenning to quieter stuff or if there's a gap, you periodically get a bunch of static in your ears.  One program I listened to had such a low base sound volume that I had trouble getting a \"lock\" on it at all, and when I did, and I turned up the volume high enough so I could hear it well, it quickly disconnected and I got deafening static in my ears; these headphones could damage your hearing!  It is a sad statement about JVC that they would allow this product to be sold at all.  I wouldn't be surprised if they get slapped with a few law suits for these. \n",
